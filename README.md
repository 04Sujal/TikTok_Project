My Capstone Project for Google Advanced Professional Data Analytics Course
This repository contains the code for the machine learning model developed to differentiate between claims and opinions for user complaints. The model is trained on a dataset of user complaints, labeled as either claims or opinions. The model then uses this training data to predict whether a new user complaint is a claim or an opinion.
The model's findings can be used by TikTok to improve its customer service. For example, TikTok can use the model to identify user complaints that are claims and require further investigation. TikTok can also use the model to identify user complaints that are opinions and respond to them in a more conversational way.
